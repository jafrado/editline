editline
========

Small command-line editor; biggest limitation is it only handles
80-character lines.

This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any program
to provide command-line editing and recall.  This code has been untouched,
but still working, since 1993.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library.  It is a fraction
of the size, and offers far fewer features.  It is distributed under
the Apache v2 license.

Configuration is done in the Makefile.  Type "make testit" to get a small
"shell" for testing.
